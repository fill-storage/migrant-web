## 1. Always Get a Written Contract

- Never accept a job based only on a verbal promise.
- Your contract should be in a language you understand. If not, ask for a translation.
- Keep a signed copy of your contract for your records.

## 2. Check the Key Details

Make sure your contract clearly states:

- Your job title and main duties
- Salary, payment schedule, and overtime rates
- Working hours, days off, and annual leave
- Accommodation and food (if provided)
- Health insurance and other benefits

## 3. Understand Your Rights

- You have the right to keep your own passport and personal documents.
- You should not be asked to pay recruitment fees.
- Your employer must follow Qatari labor laws, including minimum wage and working hours.

## 4. Ask Questions Before Signing

- If anything is unclear, ask your employer or a trusted advisor to explain.
- Do not sign a contract you do not fully understand or agree with.

## 5. Compare the Offer With Official Information

- Check if your contract matches what was promised by the recruitment agency or in job advertisements.
- If you notice differences, clarify them before signing.

## 6. Know How to Get Help

- If you feel pressured or threatened, contact your embassy or a local support organization.
- The Ministry of Labour in Qatar can help resolve disputes.

## 7. After Arrival: Review Again

- When you arrive in Qatar, review your contract again. If your job or conditions are different from what was agreed, seek help immediately.
